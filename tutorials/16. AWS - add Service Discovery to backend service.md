Before we proceed to add frontend service we should note that each ECS service is running in a separated envrionment. The frontend would not be able to find backend service and connect to it. We need add service discovery option to backend.

A running service could be discovered by registering a name for it. To do this, navigate to **AWS Cloud Map --> Create namespace**. Fill in the following:

>Namespace name: mylearningapp.local
>
>Instance discovery: API calls and DNS queries in VPCs
>
>VPC: my-vpc

Back to ECS my-backend-task-service, click **Update service** and scroll to **Service discovery**. Enable **Use service discovery**, fill in the following:

>Existing namespace: choose the namespace we created
>
>Configure service discovery service: choose **Create a new service discovery service**
>
>Service discovery name: backend

With the above confiuration, the backend running instance would have a name as "backend.mylearningapp.local". This is the exact name we defined in frontend nginx.conf:

```
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend.mylearningapp.local:8000/;

    ...
```

When frontend task is launched, it will use this name to dicover backend service.
