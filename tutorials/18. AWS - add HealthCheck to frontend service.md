For the frontend service, we also should add health check to further confirm it is working correctly. Navigate to **ECS --> Task definitions --> my-frontend-task --> Create new revision**.

Scroll to **HealthCheck** section, fill in the following:

>Command: CMD-SHELL,curl -f http://localhost:80/api/randomUser || exit 1
>
>Interval: 30
>
>Timeout: 5
>
>Start period: 60
>
>Retries: 3

For my-frontend-task-service, click **my-frontend-task-service**, select the lasted frontend task for **Task definition revision**.

Wait some time for the service enter into Running state. Switch to tab **Tasks**. In the task list we should see a task in Running status, and Health status should be "Healthy".

To further check if this HealthCheck would detect any issue, we can again temporarily block database access and see how services are effected. 

Navigate to **Aurora and RDS --> Databases
 --> userdb --> Actions**, choose **Stop temporarily**. We would see both tasks for backend and frontend service become unhealthy. Restart the database, wait some minutes. Both tasks will become healthy.
