To run our application in ECS, we need to first create a cluster. Navigate to **ECS --> Clusters --> Create cluster**. Fill in the following:

>Cluster name: my-learning-app-cluster
>
>Infrastructure: AWS Fargate
>
>Logging for ECS Exec: None

Note the logging is enabled by default but I chose to disbable it in the above configuration. The more options you enabled the more you may be charged. I'll disable any of the options which are not going to use for the turotials in order to keep the AWS charge fee minimum.

AWS Fargate provides a serverless way to run the container application. We don't need to provision servers that are used for hosting cluster and running application. They are provisioned and managed by AWS when we start running the application.

Wait a minute for cluster creation complete, then verify if we can get cluster info from AWS CLI:

>aws ecs describe-clusters --clusters my-learning-app-cluster
